This specific network was test/designed to use images with a resolution of 256x256. 
There are two images that are both 256px by 256px as an example. 
Each are not going to be used during the final testing/run. 
They are merely used for debugging to make sure the network can perform properly. 
Feel free to use any 256 by 256 image or any other image resolution for that matter. 
Any image file that is supported by Java's IO is also supported, such as PNG or JPG.
